This dataset contains the following json files:
1. CamRest676_annotated.json: the new annotated dataset for generative ellipsis and co-reference resolution research for task-oriented dialogue.
2. CamRest676.json: the original woz dialogue dataset, which contains the conversion from users and wizards, as well as a set of coarse labels for each user turn.
3. CamRestDB.json: the Cambridge restaurant database file, containing restaurants in the Cambridge UK area and a set of attributes.
4. CamRestOTGY.json: specific all the values the three informable slots can take.
